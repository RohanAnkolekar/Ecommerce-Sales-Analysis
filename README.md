# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis
This Ecommerce Sales Dashboard project utilizes Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. The interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Year-to-Date (YTD) sales metrics, including profit, quantity sold, and profit margin. It enables users to analyze Year-on-Year (YoY) growth, track monthly trends with sparklines, assess sales performance by customer category, state, and region. Additionally, the dashboard highlights the top/bottom 5 products by sales and evaluates YTD sales based on shipping types, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the dynamic ecommerce landscape."
